# Digitalization in research

Authors: Hannah Metzler <metzler@csh.ac.at>, Jana Lasser <jana.lasser@tugraz.at>

In the module “digitalization in research” we will provide insights and practice experience for digital methods that are used for a broad range of activities in daily research practice. Our module is structured into four major topics:

* Intro (15-30min)
* 1.5h: Digitally enhanced literature search and management. Here we will cover 
    * Tools to find relevant articles (30min)
    * Ways to stay informed about new articles (15min)
    * Locally and collaboratively managing relevant literature (45min, Zotero integration, ref lists)
* 2h Tools and workflows to manage collaborations. Here we will cover 
    * Living documents (Google docs + Overleaf + HackMD 30min)
    * Collaborative code writing (Git + GitHub 30min (Lunch break) + 30min instead of long lunch break)
    * Tools for project management in collaborations (Git / Trello) 30 min
    * Tools for communication in collaborations (Discord / Slack) 30 min
* 3h 50 min  Ensuring transparency and reproducibility through open research practices. Here we will cover
    * 30h Intro biases + reproducibility (30 min exercise/discussion) 
    * Best practice bazaar 1h
    * Research designs and workflows to ensure transparent and reproducible results (prereg) 30 min, Online experiments: MTurk/Prolific
    * Data management practices and platforms for sharing data (30 Min, 15 intro + 15 choose platform) (Metadaten, Size, Inhalt)

    * Good documentation practices (MD tutorial 20 min)
    * Exercise: Making your research resources and methods transparent and findable: OSF Markdown (30 min)
    * Coding notebooks and executable articles (15min)
    * Coding best practices and platforms for sharing code (GitHub, Docker, Requirements) (15min)
    * Licenses (15 + 15min) 

* 3h Using digital tools to communicate your research. Here we will cover
    * New publishing practices: Preprints, Overlay journals, Reg Reports, Exploratory Reports 30 min
    * Prereg exercise 45 min
    * 15min Sherpa Romeo: which journals allow preprints?
* Research communication opportunities on [social media] platforms (research gate, Twitter + another) (1h30min)

Every topic will feature an introduction into the challenges and possibilities that digitalization brings in the respective area of research practice. We will show examples of best practices and introduce free and open tools that can be used by researchers to digitally enhance their workflows and make them efficient and transparent. Since learning happens best through doing, our module will be very “hands on”. We will ask participants to bring their own research projects to the lecture and implement workflows that they have learned about right away and in their own research context.

In addition, we will allocate some time to a “bazaar of best practices”, where lecturers and participants can share short tips and tricks to make the (digital) life of researchers easier, for example how an efficient folder structure to organize research projects could look like. 
Depending on the background and research interests of participants, we also offer to include a small section about “modern forms of data acquisition”, such as web scraping, accessing data from Twitter or Reddit through APIs, and services such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific.
