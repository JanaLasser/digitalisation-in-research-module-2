# Digitalization in research
*Module 2 of the "[Digital Transformation in Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_S4r1-Gl2U)" course, November 25 & 26, 2021.*



## Instructors
[Hannah Metzler](https://hannahmetzler.eu/) <metzler@csh.ac.at>, PostDoc at [MedUni Vienna](https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/) and the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna](https://www.csh.ac.at/).

## Introduction
In the module “digitalization in research” we will provide insights and practice experience for digital methods that are used for a broad range of activities in daily research practice. Our module is structured into four major areas of activity that reseracher's engage in in their daily practice: 

1. Finding information and staying informed.
2. Managing collaborations.
3. Doing (reproducible) research.
4. Communicating research results.

Every topic will feature an introduction into the challenges and possibilities that digitalization brings in the respective area of research practice. We will show examples of best practices and introduce free and open tools that can be used by researchers to digitally enhance their workflows and make them efficient and transparent. Since learning happens best through doing, our module will be very “hands on”. We will ask participants to bring their own research projects to the lecture and implement workflows that they have learned about right away and in their own research context.

## Preparation for participants
To make full use of the sessions, please bring your laptop and charger. We will do a lot of practical exercises, which you can use to work on your own research projects if you have your laptop with you. 

* If you want to follow the [literature management demonstrations](https://janalasser.github.io/digitalisation-in-research-module-2/02_literature/index.html#1):
    * Make an account at [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [install](https://www.zotero.org/download/) Zotero (Standalone) and the Connector for the browser you usually use.
    * Make an account on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com). **Note**: if you want to later use this account in the “research communication” demonstration, make sure you use an account name (the text after the “@” that is either close to your real name or sounds otherwise professional. You don’t need to fill your profile with more information about you, we will do that together.

    * Make an account on [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/).

* If you want to follow the [Git & GitHub demonstration](https://janalasser.github.io/digitalisation-in-research-module-2/03_collaborations/03_02_collaborative_code_writing/slides/index.html):
    * Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (alternatively: if your institution hosts a GitLab instance, make an account there).
    * Download and install [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (works for Windows, Mac and Linux). When asked, link your GitHub (GitLab) account with GitKraken.
    * **NOTE**: git can also be useful for non-coders that want to version-control their text files (for example research articles or a thesis they are writing).

* If you want to follow the [project management demonstration](https://janalasser.github.io/digitalisation-in-research-module-2/03_collaborations/03_03_project_management/slides/index.html):
    * Install the [slack desktop app](https://slack.com/downloads) OR [discord client](https://discord.com/download) (works for Windows, Mac and Linux) OR make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (alternatively: if your institution hosts a GitLab instance, make an account there).

* If you want to use the preregistration exercise for your own research:
    * Bring an idea for a research project or study you are about to or would like to start in the future.

* If you want to follow the [good documentation practices demonstration](https://janalasser.github.io/digitalisation-in-research-module-2/04_transparency_and_reproducibility/04_04_documentation/slides/index.html): 
    * Make an account on [OSF](https://osf.io/) (Open Science Framework) OR make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (alternatively: if your institution hosts a GitLab instance, make an account there).
    * If you want to use the exercise for your own research: think about a project (finished or ongoing) you would like to document and bring the relevant files.

* If you want to follow the research communication on Twitter demonstration:
    * Make an account on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). Make sure you use an account name (the text after the “@” that is either close to your real name or sounds otherwise professional. You don’t need to fill your profile with more information about you, we will do that together.
    * Bring: EITHER a preprint/paper that you have recently published and would like to present to a larger public OR a paper that you have recently enjoyed reading and would like to review for a broader public.
