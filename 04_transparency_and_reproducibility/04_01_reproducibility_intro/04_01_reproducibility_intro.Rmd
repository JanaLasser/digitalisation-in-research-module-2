# Reproducibility

* Finding/evaluating journals:
    * [Scimagojr](www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php): Rankings per discipline
    * [TOP factor](https://topfactor.org/): Ranked by transparency & openess criteria ([more](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/top-factor-rates-journals-on-transparency-openness))
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
