# Setting up a discord server with asana and dropbox integration
* Find two teammates to work with (so you are a group of three).
* Make sure you all have a discord account, asana and dropbox account. Download the [discord client](https://discord.com/download) application for your computer, install it and log in. 
* One of you will be responsible for managing discord, one for asana and the other for Dropbox. Decide who does what. The team members will have different tasks (see below).

## Team member 1: discord
* Open your discord client and create a new server (big "+" symbol on the left sidebar).
* Make two new channels on your server, one dedicated to testing asana, the other dedicated to testing drop box integration.
* Invite your friends to the channel by sending them an invite link: click on the "Create invite" symbol next to the channel name and copy the invite link from there.
* Create a new role "admin" on the server with all permissions: click on the "down" arrow next to the server name -> go to "server settings" -> "Roles" -> "create role". Manage the permissions in the "permissions" tab.
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of discord: what functionality to you get for free, what pricing options exist and what do you get for them?


## Team member 2: asana
* Log into your asana account and create a new project: follow asana's workflow to select a suitable board (for example "general project management" with a "board" layout).
* Invite your team members to the project board.
* Create an account with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), since we are going to use this service to integrate asana and dropbox into discord.
* Follow the [Zapier instructions](https://zapier.com/apps/asana/integrations/discord) to connect the asana borad your team member shared with discord (I haven't tested this and hope it works if you are the server admin. If it doesn't, coordinate with the "discord" team member to get it done).
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of asana: what functionality to you get for free, what pricing options exist and what do you get for them?

## Team member 3: dropbox
* Create a new folder in your dropbox.
* Share the new folder with your team members.
* Create an account with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), since we are going to use this service to integrate asana and dropbox into discord.
* Follow the [Zapier instructions](https://zapier.com/apps/discord/integrations/dropbox) to connect the dropbox folder your team member shared with discord (I haven't tested this and hope it works if you are the server admin. If it doesn't, coordinate with the "discord" team member to get it done).
* Link dropbox to asana by following [these instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/app-integrations/asana).
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of dropbox: how much storage do you get for free? What are the pricing options and what do you get for them?

## All team members
* In dropbox: Make a new file in the shared dropbox folder.
* In asana: Go to the project board and make a new task: 
	* Write some text in the task description and create some subtasks. 
	* Link the file you just created in the dropbox to the task (you might need to enable cookies from dropbox in your browser).
	* Set a task priority and a due date for the task. 
	* Assign a team member to the task. Make sure all team members have at least one task assigned to them.
* In discord: Check out what notifications where automatically sent to the asana discord channel while you were creating tasks. Are you happy with the notifications? You have some options to customize notifications in Zapier.
* In discord: Check out what notifications where automatically sent to the dropbox discord channel while you were creating files. Are you happy with the notifications? You have some options to customize notifications in Zapier.
* Manage your notifications
	* In discord: navigate to your profile settings (at the bottom left of the desktop app, cogwheel icon next to your profile picture). Go to "notifications" in the left sidebar. Select settings that suit you.
	* On the discord server, you can mute the notifications in a given channel by clicking the "bell" symbol on the top right.
	* Try mentioning your team members in the chat using @[TEAM MATE NAME] and see what kind of notifications you receive.
