# Setting up a slack workspace with Trello and Google Drive integration
* Find two teammates to work with (so you are a group of three).
* Make sure you all have a Slack account, trello account and google account.
* One of you will be responsible for managing slack, one for trello and the other for Google. Decide who does what. The team members will have different tasks (see below).

## Team member 1: Slack
* Create a new workspace [here](https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew).
* Invite the other team-members to your workspace.
* Install the "Google Drive" and "Tello" Apps (search for "Apps" in slack).
* Authorize Slack to use your Google Drive and Trello accounts.
* Make sure the other two team members also authorize their Google Drive and Trello accounts in Slack (they should navigate to the "Apps" channel in Slack and click on the respective apps to start the authorization process).
* Make two new channels: we are going to test Trello integration in one and Google Drive integration in the other.
* Go to the channel you want to test Trello in and invite the Trello app (/invige @Trello)
* Make sure your team-mates join both channels.
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of the free Slack version. What pricing options exist and what features do they unlock?


## Team member 2: Trello
* Log into your trello account and create a new board.
* Invite the other team members to your board.
* Enable the "Slack power-up" for your board by navigating to the settings (top right), click on "Power-ups" and search for "Slack".
* Enable the "Google drive power-up" for your board.
* Make a couple of lists.
* Add some items including a checklist or two to your list (can be made-up stuff).
* Go to the slack channel that is dedicated to testing trello. Link the new trello board you just created to the channel (/trello link [URL TO BOARD]).
* Set the channel to a Trello list (/trello set-list)
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of the free Trello version. What pricing options exist and what features do they unlock?


## Team member 3: Google Drive
* Create a new google doc. 
* Go to the slack channel that is dedicated for testing Google Drive. Post the link to the document in the channel.
* Make sure your team members have editing access to the document (slack is offering you a dialogue to change editing rights).
* Add some text and a comment inside the google doc.
* Ask your team members to add some text and comments in the google doc as well.
* If you have time, investigate about the limitations of the free Google Drive version. What pricing options exist and what features do they unlock?


## All team members: 
* In slack: Make a new card on the Trello list and assign one of your team members to it (/trello add [TEAMMATES] [CARD NAME])
* In slack: Create a new Google doc by clicking on the lightning bolt next to the text input field and then selecting "Google Drive" -> "Create a document".
* In Trello: Attach the document to your new trello card by clicking on your card -> "Google Drive" (on the right of the card under "power-ups") -> "attach a file" (you can search for the doc by name)
* Set a due-date on a card (for example /trello set-due next Thursday at 2pm)
* Comment a trello card (/trello comment [SOME TEXT])
* Reply to a comment in the Google Doc directly from Slack: Go to "Apps" -> "Google Drive" (you should see your team mate's comments in the "Messages" tab). Hover on a comment and click on "Reply on thread" and write some text to add a reply to the doc.
* In slack: type a message in one of the channels, reply to a message of a team member by opening a thread for the message.
* In slack: direct a message to a team member by typing @[TEAM MEMBER NAME] in front of the message.
* In google docs: direct a message to a team member by typing @[TEAM MEMBER NAME] in your comment. 
* Manage your notifications
	* In general, you can set three levels of notifications: receive all notifications for a given channel, receive only notifications for messages directed at you (@), receive no notifications.
	* Slack: right-click on a channel, go to "Change notifications" to change the notification mode or "mute channel" to turn off all notifications for this channel.
	* Google Drive single document: open the document in your browser, click on the "comment" symbol (top right), click on the "bell" symbol to adapt your notification settings.
	* Trello: navigate to the trello board, click on the "Slack" button (should appear at the top right after the "Slack power-up" was added to the board). Configure the notifications in a way you want them to be as a team.
